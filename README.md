#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic approach to creating and maintaining software. It's the controlled application of engineering principles to ensure that software is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs.
Software engineering is the breath that powers the technology industry. The digital age is alive  because software powers everything from smartphones to space stations. It has enabled mobile banking, and secure vulnerabilities enabled efficient systems that allow remote work and globalization. These are based on operating systems, web applications, mobile apps, and embedded systems which are but a few showcase the wide range of software engineering applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Three significant milestones in the evolution of software engineering that I can pinpoint are:

1. The development of high-level programming languages in the 1950s: Languages such as FORTRAN made it easier for individuals to write code, transitioning away from machine language. This enabled more people to become programmers, resulting in greater productivity.

2. The emergence of structured programming in the 1970s: This technique offered notions such as modularity and improved code organization. It made programs easier to comprehend and maintain, which was critical as software became increasingly sophisticated.

3. The emergence of object-oriented programming during the 1980s and 1990s: This approach, found in languages such as Java and C++, helped manage complexity in large software systems by arranging code into reusable objects.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The software Development Cycle involves 6 steps which include:
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting what the software needs to do.
2. Design: Planning how the software will be structured and function.
3. Implementation: Writing the actual code based on the design.
4. Testing: Checking the software to make sure it works correctly and meets requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software for use.
6. Maintenance: Fixing bugs and adding new features after the software is in use.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and Agile are two distinct approaches to software development. Waterfall is a linear process that requires each phase to be completed before proceeding to the next. It is ideal for tasks with specific, unchanging requirements, such as medical device software. Agile, on the other hand, emphasizes flexibility and iteration. It divides the project into smaller components and enables for modifications along the way. Agile is suitable for projects where the needs may change, such as designing a new mobile app.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
In a software engineering team, a Software Developer produces code and addresses technical issues. A Quality Assurance Engineer investigates and reports flaws in the program to ensure it satisfies quality requirements. A Project Manager manages the entire project, including timeframes, resources, and communication among team members and stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential tools for software development. IDEs, such as Visual Studio or Eclipse, include a comprehensive collection of tools for authoring, debugging, and testing code. They speed up code and help catch issues early. VCS, such as Git and Subversion, track code changes over time. They let numerous people to collaborate on the same project while also managing separate versions of the software.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software developers encounter obstacles such as changing project objectives, meeting tight deadlines, and coping with outdated, difficult-to-maintain code (technical debt). To tackle these challenges, they can employ solutions such as adopting flexible development methodologies, boosting stakeholder communication, routinely updating and improving outdated code, and implementing excellent project management practices.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
There are several forms of testing in software quality assurance:
1. Unit testing which examines specific areas of the code.
2. Integration testing ensures that diverse components of the product perform well together.
3. System testing determines whether the entire software system meets its criteria.
4. Acceptance testing ensures that the software meets user requirements.
These tests are vital because they help identify and resolve issues at various stages, ensuring that the final program is reliable and satisfies user expectations.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the skill of writing clear and effective instructions (prompts) for AI models to produce the desired results. It's vital when working with AI because it allows for more accurate and helpful responses. Good prompt engineering can improve AI tools' effectiveness and usability, bridging the gap between what humans want and what AI systems can understand and generate.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt could be; "How do I install linux"
A clear, specific, and concise prompt 
I have a lenovo Thinkpad x240 laptop with 8 GB RAM, and a 256GB SSD, with a Windows 10 OS. Provide me with a clear, well explained, step-by-step process of installing Linux Mint along side my windows 10 OS using a bootable flash disk. In addition, provide a guideline on how to optimise performance with both operating systems installed for maximum efficiency.
The vague prompt was overly generalized and no significant output can be objectively utilized. The improved prompt is very clear, stating the necessary specs of the laptop and the operating as well as the specific type of Linux system and the method which is a bootable flash disk. In addition, it also asks for a suggestion to enhance perfomance when both operating systems are installed based on the specs.
